# AtlantaWeather_LessonProject
I completed this project as part of a lesson in a class I am taking. 

As you're likely aware, [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) has become a hot topic during the 2st century. In this report we'll take a look at some of the different data points collected with regard to the weather in Atlanta, GA from 1997-2016. We will use the data to investigate any trends visible in changing of our local climate. 

Many believe our planet is in fact warming due to our production of greenhouse gase. A warming earth can have various [effects](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/) on the ecosystems in which we live. It is hypothesised that temperatures are in fact rising and we will investigate any relationships that may exist between the rising temperatures and other weather conditions in our local climate. 

The data used can be found [here](https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/ws-722197.html).
